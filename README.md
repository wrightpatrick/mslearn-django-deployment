## General Information
- I made a full stack application that allows users to browse shelters, add new shelters, view and add entries for new pets available for adoption in those shelters
- This app is made to increase awareness of available pets in the area and to list pets available for adoption.
- I wanted to make a full-stack Python application that is built using the Django Framework.
- I wanted to compare Django with Flask and better understand the benefits of each framework.


## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Azure Web Services


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Ability to add pets to existing shelters (all users)
- Ability to add new shelters (admin access required)


## Setup
A requirements.txt is located in the main folder of the project and lists the dependancies needed to run this project.
Begin by either forking this, or the ms-learn-django project repo. You need Python installed on your machine.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Make a more appealing front-end design / user experience
- Incorporate the pets.com API for integration with a larger network of shelters.

To do:
